Overview: A Museum was started in the year 1853, in a part of the Bungalow of John Allan Broun, then Director 
of the Trivandrum Observatory. The specimen of Travancore rocks offered by General Cullen formed the earliest 
collection in the institution. This Museum was thrown open to the public in 1857. In 1880 the new building designed 
by Chisholm, Architect to the Government of Madras and named after Lord Napier, a Governor of Madras, was 
built. Natural history specimens formed the chief exhibit there besides the indigenous arts, crafts, industries and 
archaeology. Later a steady growth of the Museum collections in the Art and Natural History sections were achieved. 
In 1936, following the recommendations of the Museums of India Survey Committee, the Museum was further split 
up into a Museum of Natural History and an Art Museum. The Natural History exhibits were shifted to a building at 
Shankumukhom and placed under the control of Travancore University. The formation of the Kerala State in 1956 
brought about an administrative re-union of the Museums, the Zoos and the Botanical Gardens at Thiruvananthapuram 
with which was also integrated the Cochin State Museum and Zoo at Trichur

Year of Establishment: 2016

contribution to the formation of the State of Meghalaya and breaking away from Assam was undeniable. Just like other 
leaders who fought for the freedom of the Country, he too fought for the freedom of the State. The Museum design 
itself is planned so as to tell a story of his life, with one view window giving a glimpse of the ruins of his ancestral 
home. The Museum looks juxtaposed against the Laitkynsew landscape, touching it lightly and bringing in natural 
light into the interiors. Due to the heavy monsoon rains, this museum’s roof-form with larger overhangs was made of 
metal and the approach walkway is also protected, creating a tunnel-like approach into the main gallery space.

Address: Arna Vihar, Near Famous Arneshwar Mahadev Mandir, Arna Jharna Village, Moklawas - 342001

Theme: Ethnographic Museum
Overview: This Museum includes nearly 30 different varieties of trees and shrubs and is laid with a variegated carpet 
of about 30 different kinds of grass. Complexes of earth-red buildings in the local style of village architecture blend 
with the landscape. The museum boasts mainly of an extensive collection of brooms from Rajasthan, indicating entire 
galaxies of rituals and beliefs associated with them. A series of videos also highlights the communities, labour, skills 
and even risks associated with broom production with a view to sensitising the audience. Those technologies are fun-
damentally different from today’s powerful production of generic drugs. The second module consists of a stunning col-
lection of musical instruments unique to western India, including popular instruments such as the ravanhatta, gujratan 
sarangi, sindhi sarangi and the surinda, and some examples that are no longer used or produced, such as the jantar, 
jogia sarangi and nagfani. Pottery and puppetry are highlighted in two more modules. The museum pays tribute to 
the local communities and their local foundations of knowledge, art and culture, which is not a thing of the past, but a 
resource for rebuilding the present.
