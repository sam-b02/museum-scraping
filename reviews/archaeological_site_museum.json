But still the boat leave around 2.30 pm because one group that came by bus had some problems. it took like 30 mins on boat. the weather was pleasant and cool. we got there around 3.30 pm and have to go back to the boat by 4.15 pm because the boat will leave at 4.30pm. it was a very short time.

The informative signage in both English and Telugu enhances the experience, making it accessible to a diverse audience.\n\nOne of the standout features is the panoramic view from the museum, which adds to the overall ambiance and offers a beautiful perspective of the surrounding landscape. The serene environment complements the historical depth of the artifacts on display.\n\nOverall, the Nagarjuna Sagar Museum is a must-visit for anyone interested in history and culture.

It is named after the Buddhist scholar and savant Acharya Nagarjuna, is situated in Macherla Mandal of the Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. In ancient times it was known as Vijayapuri (City of Victory), christened after Vijaya Satyakarni, a later Satavahana ruler. Now this valley is submerged under the vast man made reservoir caused by the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam built across river Krishna. It is approachable by motor launches operating from Vijayapuri South. Macherla is the nearest Railway station located 24 km west of Vijayapuri South.The cultural vestiges of this valley, initially brought to light by Shri S.Venkataramayya, a teacher, was made known to the scholars by Shri A.R. Sarasvati in March 1926 CE. Sarva Shri A.H.Longhurst and M.H.Quraishi (1924-31 CE) and T.N.Ramachandran (1938 CE) of the survey under took excavations here exposing Brahmanical and Buddhist structures and retrieved lime stone slabs, inscriptions etc. With the decision of constructing a dam across the river Krishna, the valley was subjected to intensive, large scale excavations to salvage the prestigious relics of the past, by the Survey, under a special project headed by Dr. R. Subramanyam for well over six continuous years (1954-60 CE).Due to this systematic work in over 130 sites spread in 24 square km, a cultural sequence from Early Stone Age to Medieval times was established. The remains of more than 70 structures and an array of antiquities in various media including the reliquaries of the Master and his disciples were discovered. To avoid total submergence, some of these outstanding structures were reconstructed on the island and on the eastern bank of the lake near Anupu and the antiquities are exhibited in the museum. This feat of reconstruction of remains using original raw material following similar ecosystem and alignment is first of its kind.",
